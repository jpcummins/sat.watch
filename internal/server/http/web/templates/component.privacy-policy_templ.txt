However, this data is never shared with any third parties.</li></ul><h2 class=\"text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4\">2. How We Use Your Information</h2><p>We use your monitored Bitcoin addresses solely to track transactions on the blockchain and notify you via email or webhooks.

While no system is completely secure, we follow industry standards, including encryption, HTTPS, and secure storage methods, to protect your information from unauthorized access.
